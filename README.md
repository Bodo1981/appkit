# appkit
This is an extension for the [mosby](https://github.com/sockeqwe/mosby) library from [Hannes Dorfmann](http://hannesdorfmann.com/).

It contains a few default activities and fragments which are often used in android development (e.g. Activity with Toolbar, Activity with Tabs, Fragment with RecyclerView, ...)

#### CBActivityFragment
Displays a simple activity with a container view for a fragment:

* **createFragmentToDisplay():** provide the fragment which should be displayed

#### CBActivityToolbar
Displays a simple activity with a toolbar on top.<br />
There is only one optional method you can override:

* **readExtras(Bundle extras)** read extras passed to activity

#### CBActivityToolbarFragment
Displays a simple activity with a toolbar which contains a fragment.<br />
Same as CBActivityToolbar plus one additional method:

* **createFragmentToDisplay():** provide the fragment which should be displayed

#### CBActivityMvpToolbar
Displays a simple mvp activity with a toolbar on top.<br/>
You have to implement only three methods:

* **createPresenter():** provide a presenter which loads the data
* **loadData(boolean isContentVisible):** load the data (e.g. presenter.loadListData); isContentVisible helps to distinguish between the first load (no data visible) and for example a pull to refresh or click on an error view (data already visible)
* **setData(D data):** is called when the presenter has loaded the data
 
There a are a few optional methods you can override if you need to:
* **readExtras(Bundle extras):** read extras passed to activity

#### CBActivityMvpToolbarTabs
Displays a simple mvp activity with a toolbar and tabs on top.<br/>
Same as CBActivityMvpToolbar plus one additional method:

* **createAdapter():** provide a PagerAdapter which is responsible for displaying the tabs

#### CBActivityMvpToolbarFragment
Displays a simple mvp activity with a toolbar which only contains a fragment.<br/>
Same as CBActivityMvpToolbar plus one additional method:

* **createFragmentToDisplay():** provide the fragment which should be displayed

#### CBFragmentMvpRecyclerView
A simple fragment with a recycler view.

* **createPresenter():** provide a presenter which loads the data
* **createAdapter():** provide a adapter which displays the data
* **loadData(boolean isContentVisible):** load the data (e.g. presenter.loadListData); isContentVisible helps to distinguish between the first load (no data visible) and for example a pull to refresh or click on an error view (data already visible)
* **setData(D data):** is called when the presenter has loaded the data

#### CBFragmentMvpRecyclerViewPtr
Excactly the same as CBFragmentMvpRecyclerView but with pull to refresh functionallity.<br/>
The default behavior for pull to refresh is to call the **loadData(true)** function but this can be overriden in **onRefreshStarted()**

All this activities and fragments also have a viewstate implementation. For further information see [Mosby Framework](http://hannesdorfmann.com/mosby/)

# Additional stuff

#### CBAdapterRecyclerView
A simple RecyclerView.Adapter with a few helper methods to add, delete items. It also has a setter and getter for the data.

* **onCreateViewHolder(ViewGroup parent, int viewType):** create the viewholder
* **onBindViewHolder(RecyclerView.ViewHolder viewHolder, int position, int viewType):** bind the viewholder
* **getItemViewType(int position):** (optional) only needed if you have different view types

#### CBAdapterRecyclerViewParallax
Same as CBAdapterRecyclerView with an extra parallax effect to the specified view types

* **isItemParallaxScrollable(int position, int viewType)**: here you can say which item should have the parallax effect by position and/or view type
* **doParallaxScrolling(RecyclerView.ViewHolder viewHolder, int position, int viewType, int pixelAlreadyScrolledOut):**: do the parallax effect
